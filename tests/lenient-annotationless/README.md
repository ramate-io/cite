# `lenient-annotationless`
This directory is intended to test issues with enabling both the `lenient` and `annotationless` flags ad hoc. None have yet been reported, so it is assumed the [`cite-core`](../../cite/core/README.md) unit tests should correctly cover and that the [`lenient`](../lenient/) e2e tests should be demonstrative.
