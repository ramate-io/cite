# Dependency Verification Test

This test crate verifies that the `cite` procedural macro does not add heavy runtime dependencies to consuming applications.

## Issue Context

This test addresses [issue #15](https://github.com/ramate-io/cite/issues/15) - ensuring that the `cite` macro has zero runtime overhead and doesn't pull in heavy dependencies like `reqwest`, `scraper`, `regex`, etc. into the final binary.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The tests **confirm that issue #15 is not actually a problem**. The `cite` procedural macro is working correctly:

- ✅ `cite` is properly identified as a procedural macro
- ✅ Procedural macro dependencies are **not** bundled into the final binary 
- ✅ Heavy dependencies like `reqwest`, `scraper`, `regex`, etc. do **not** appear in runtime dependencies
- ✅ The final binary only contains actual runtime dependencies

## Test Structure

### `src/lib.rs`
- Simple library that uses the `cite` macro
- Demonstrates various citation patterns
- Serves as a realistic test case for dependency analysis

### `tests/dependency_verification.rs`
Contains several tests:

1. **`test_cite_dependencies`** ✅ - Verifies that only `cite` is listed as a direct dependency
2. **`test_cite_no_heavy_runtime_dependencies`** ✅ - **Confirms cite works correctly as `proc-macro`**
3. **`test_cite_macro_expansion`** ✅ - Verifies the macro expands correctly  
4. **`test_binary_size_reasonable`** ✅ - Verifies the final binary doesn't include heavy dependencies

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with ignored tests (will fail until issue #15 is resolved)
cargo test -- --ignored
```

## Expected Behavior

### Current Status (Issue #15 resolved):
- ✅ `test_cite_dependencies` passes - only `cite` as direct dependency
- ✅ `test_cite_no_heavy_runtime_dependencies` passes - no heavy runtime deps
- ✅ `test_cite_macro_expansion` passes - macro works correctly  
- ✅ `test_binary_size_reasonable` passes - binary is lightweight

## Key Findings

**Issue #15 was based on a misunderstanding.** Rust procedural macros do **NOT** include their dependencies in the final binary. Our tests confirm:

1. ✅ **`proc-macro` isolation works correctly** - `cite`'s heavy dependencies (`reqwest`, `scraper`, etc.) are not bundled into consuming applications
2. ✅ **Zero runtime overhead** - the `cite` macro only affects compilation, not runtime
3. ✅ **Proper dependency separation** - `proc-macro` dependencies are build-time only

The `cargo tree` output that might have caused confusion shows the **build graph**, not runtime dependencies. Using `cargo_metadata` to analyze the resolved dependency graph correctly excludes `proc-macro` dependencies from runtime.

## Integration

This test is part of the workspace and runs with `cargo test` from the repository root.
